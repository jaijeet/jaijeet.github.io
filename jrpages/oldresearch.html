<h2>Automated computational macromodelling</h2>
<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, the field of model-order reduction (MOR) (also known as 
reduced-order modelling (ROM)) rose to prominence in VLSI CAD, chiefly in the context of timing analysis
of the large interconnect networks within modern integrated circuits. These networks are often
so large &ndash; some networks have as many as 60 million nodes &ndash; that simulating at the circuit level
is infeasible. Model reduction uses mathematical and numerical techniques to reduce these large
networks to much smaller ones, while conserving important input/output characteristics (such as
delay metrics). This sub-area within CAD developed rapidly in the 1990s, with the rediscovery,
adaptation, extension and application of concepts and ideas from disciplines in EE, CS and math.
Most notably, iterative numerical algebra, Krylov-subspace methods, and concepts from classical
linear dynamical system theory and control theory have led to a variety of advances. Upto 1998,
however, MOR research was confined to linear time invariant (LTI) circuits; indeed, largely to RC
and RLC networks.</p>
<p>In 1998, using ideas from multitime methods and LTI MOR, we showed that linear
time-varying systems could be reduced using Krylov methods. This work opened up a new sub-field
within CAD, automated computational macromodelling, that has grown in importance and found
application in electronics/VLSI, biological systems, MEMS and nanoelectronics. We have
continued to work in this area and have made contributions to computational macromodelling techniques
for linear time-varying, polynomial, strongly nonlinear and oscillatory systems.</p>
<h3>Linear time-varying and weakly nonlinear systems</h3>
<p>Following initial work in which we applied explicit moment matching to the linear periodically time-
varying (LPTV) reduction problem <a href="PP1">PP1</a>, <a href="C15">C15</a>, we developed extensions based on using Krylov-
subspace methods <a href="C20">C20</a>. We then introduced reduction methods for polynomial systems <a href="C22">C22</a>,
<a href="BJ3">BJ3</a> as well. Our approach leveraged the MPDE (see Section A.2.1), applying it to LPTV systems
to achieve a simple means of separating parametric and I/O time scales. Expanding parametric time
variations using a finite basis (such as truncated Fourier), we converted LPTV systems into larger,
artificial LTI systems, on which the established machinery of LTI MOR was brought to bear. Our
automated macromodelling techniques for polynomial systems involved projection onto Kronecker
products of underlying reduced linear spaces, and have close connections with Volterra analysis of
weakly nonlinear systems.</p>
<h4>Switching, sampling and frequency-converting RF/mixed-signal blocks</h4>
<p>Linear or weakly nonlinear time-varying abstractions are well suited for systems that have linear or
weakly nonlinear input<i>output characteristics, but involve strong &ldquo;parametric&rdquo; switching, sampling
or modulation (e.g., for frequency up</i>down-conversion). We validated our LPTV reduction methods
on a variety of analog, mixed-signal/RF and power electronic circuits that fall in this category,
including switched-capacitor filters, mixers and DC-DC power converters. This work was awarded
Best Paper at ASPDAC 1999 <a href="C22">C22</a>.</p>
<h4>Power/ground-induced interference in large digital systems</h4>
<p>Later, we applied and extended time-varying computational macromodelling to develop a technique
and methodology for the problem of estimating interference &ldquo;noise&rdquo; induced in on-chip power and
ground lines by large blocks of switching digital circuitry <a href="C35">C35</a>, <a href="C37">C37</a>, <a href="BJ12">BJ12</a>. Compared to prior
approaches which were largely ad-hoc, our approach systematically extracts information from low-
level circuit descriptions, by abstracting from them simple high-level ones for quick co-simulation
with power<i>ground</i>substrate networks. We achieve this by applying time-varying macromodelling
to elemental digital blocks to extract small macromodels suitable for predicting interference effects.
Key features of our approach include: capturing time-varying effects (critical in digital interference
mechanisms), a single macromodel that captures all interference effects (including power, ground
and substrate interference), immediate applicability to any kind of device/technology, abstraction
of second-order effects, hierarchical scalability to systems of arbitrary size, etc.. We have demon-
strated typical accuracies of about 5% (considered excellent in this domain), with speedups over
full simulation of 3-4 orders of magnitude for even relatively small digital blocks.</p>
<h4>Operator-Krylov reduction of time-varying systems</h4>
<p>For linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) systems, we developed a novel operator-based frame-
work for model-order reduction by generalizing existing matrix-based Krylov-subspace algorithms
to arbitrary function-space operators <a href="C47">C47</a>. Practical benefits of this approach include significantly
enhanced algorithm and code modularity compared to previous LPTV-MOR approaches, which are
based on a-priori discretization.</p>
<h3>Trajectory methods for macromodelling strongly nonlinear systems</h3>
<p>Later, we extended the above work on linear time-varying and weakly nonlinear systems to strongly
nonlinear systems, by combining trajectory piecewise concepts from the work of Rewienski and
White with our Krylov-based polynomial macromodelling methods.</p>
<h4>Fidelity for both weak and strong nonlinearities</h4>
<p>We developed a nonlinear macromodelling method generally applicable to circuits in which both
weak and strong nonlinearities are important, such as the op-amps and comparators common in
most mixed-signal <a href="BJ24">BJ24</a>, <a href="BJ20">BJ20</a>, <a href="C31">C31</a>, <a href="C40">C40</a>. Macromodels generated by our technique are
general purpose, suitable for a wide range of time- and frequency-domain analyses important in
mixed-signal design flows. The reduced models can be used as drop-in replacements to achieve fast
system-level simulation, using a variety of time and frequency domain analyses (such as DC, AC,
transient, harmonic-balance, etc..).</p>
<h4>Timing model generation for digital blocks</h4>
<p>Recently, we demonstrated the use and potential of automated computational macromodelling for
extracting timing models of digital blocks, both combinatorial and sequential <a href="BJ24">BJ24</a>, <a href="C46">C46</a>, <a href="C65">C65</a>.
Advantages over prior current-source models include rapid automated extraction from SPICE-level
netlists, transparent retargettability to different design styles and technologies, and the ability to
correctly and holistically account for complex input waveform shapes, nonlinear and linear loading,
multiple input switching, effects of internal state, multiple I<i>Os, supply droop and substrate
interference. We have demonstrated excellent fidelity on a variety of digital gates and interface circuitry,
including multi-input NAND, NOR, XOR gates, full adders, multilevel cascades of gates, sequential
latches and I</i>O buffers.</p>
<h3>Nonlinear phase/amplitude macromodelling of self-oscillatory systems</h3>
<p>Oscillators are ubiquitous in engineering and natural systems. They have many uses; for example,
they are used to generate signals for frequency up/down-conversion in communication systems, as
clocks in digital systems, within PLLs (i.e., phase-locked loops, widely used in electronics and 
optics for synchronization, clock generation, frequency synthesis, signal conditioning) and so on. 
Systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators arise in microwave and optical systems (e.g., power combining
can be achieved using coupled oscillators), nanoelectronics (e.g., systems of coupled single-electron
tunneling phase logic devices) and especially biology (heart tissue, circadian rhythms, neural 
systems, etc.).</p>
<p>Analysis and design of oscillators and oscillator-based systems is an important part of overall system
design; however, such systems present unique computational challenges, addressing which calls for
special methods and techniques. Numerical differential equation solution is not well suited for
oscillator-based systems, for which it can be very inefficient ­ transient responses of oscillators can
last hundreds of thousands of cycles, with each cycle requiring many small timesteps for accurate
simulation of the embedded oscillator. The underlying cause is that oscillator phase errors can
accumulate without limit ­ a problem that stems from a fundamental property of oscillators, neutral
phase stability.</p>
<p>To speed up simulation of oscillator and oscillator-based systems (such as PLLs), the use of phase
macromodels has been common practice for decades. Phase macromodels attempt to capture the
relationship between inputs to an oscillator and the phase of its output waveform, using equations
that are much simpler than the full DAEs describing the oscillator. (Note that phase and its time-
derivative the instantaneous frequency are typically the quantities of primary interest in most 
oscillator applications.)</p>
<p>Our contributions in this area center around theory and computational methods for extracting non-
linear phase macromodels of amplitude-stable nonlinear oscillators. At the core of our approach
<a href="BJ5">BJ5</a>, <a href="C17">C17</a>, <a href="C16">C16</a> is a rigorous theory (employing nonlinear analysis based on Floquet theory) for
analyzing perturbations in oscillators described by arbitrary differential-algebraic equations. This
theory results in a scalar nonlinear differential equation that governs the dynamics of the oscillator's
phase. Using this nonlinear phase macromodel confers many advantages over prior linear phase
macromodels. We have applied and validated our nonlinear oscillator macromodels extensively,
predicting a variety of effects important in the design<i>analysis of mixed-signal</i>RF electronic, 
biological and nanoscale systems, typically with far superior accuracy compared to prior linear
oscillator macromodels. Speedups obtained range from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude .</p>
<h4>Krylov-based numerical methods for phase macromodel extraction</h4>
<p>Our nonlinear phase macromodel relies on a periodic vector function termed the perturbation
projection vector or PPV. We have developed theory and computational techniques <a href="BJ9">BJ9</a>, <a href="C25">C25</a> to
extract the PPV efficiently for large systems of nonlinear differential equations. These methods rely
on links with the Jacobian matrices of steady-state methods like harmonic balance and shooting and
exploit Krylov-subspace techniques.</p>
<h4>Comprehensive phase/amplitude macromodels</h4>
<p>Moreover, we have augmented our phase-only macromodel with dominant amplitude components
­ again computed efficiently using Krylov methods, after deflation of the marginally-stable phase
mode ­ to obtain comprehensive phase/amplitude macromodels for oscillators <a href="C55">C55</a> and <a href="C43">C43</a>
(nominated for Best Paper at ICCAD 2004).</p>
<h4>Multi-level extraction method for oscillator phase macromodels</h4>
<p>Numerical methods for extracting oscillator PPV macromodels often face significant robustness
and accuracy problems when confronted with digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs, core building
blocks in digital phase-locked loops), due to large RC time-constants from gated capacitors. We
have developed a hierarchical harmonic balance based technique <a href="C59">C59</a> for numerically extracting
the PPV of DCOs from their SPICE-level circuit descriptions; the new method achieves superior
convergence and PPV accuracy in the presence of large RC time-constants.</p>
<h4>Trajectory-based phase macromodels</h4>
<p>Further, we have extended the validity of these macromodels to broader regions of nonlinearity
by applying ideas from trajectory macromodelling methods <a href="C64">C64</a>. These enhanced macromodels
are useful for capturing, e.g., very large excursions in PLL control voltages during capture/lock,
common in hopping frequency synthesizers.</p>
<h4>Analytical phase macromodels of LC and ring oscillators</h4>
<p>We have also been able to obtain analytical expressions for the PPVs of commonly-used electrical
oscillator structures, such as negative-resistance LC oscillators <a href="C34">C34</a> and 3-stage ring oscillators
<a href="BJ21">BJ21</a>, <a href="C44">C44</a>. Our purely analytical Floquet analysis of the three-stage ring oscillator contains
several features of mathematical interest, including deep connections with a famous number known
as the Golden Ratio or Divine Proportion. The formulae obtained offer direct insights into aspects of
oscillator operation to designers and are useful for downstream analysis of effects such as injection
locking <a href="C49">C49</a>.</p>
<h4>Fast computational analysis of injection locking</h4>
<p>One of the key features of our computationally-extracted nonlinear oscillator macromodels is that
they correctly and efficiently capture injection locking, a nonlinear dynamical phenomenon in which
an oscillator's natural frequency changes to match that of a small injected perturbation. The
phenomenon is universal to oscillators (manifesting itself, for example, in the synchronized flashing of
fireflies, the locked swinging of grandfather clocks located close to each other, etc.) and has been
increasingly used in recent years in novel, high-speed, oscillator-based system designs.
We have shown <a href="BJ11">BJ11</a> that prior linear macromodels are fundamentally incapable of capturing
injection locking, which is an inherently nonlinear phenomenon. However, the nonlinear PPV
macromodel is able to capture various forms of injection locking, including super- and sub-harmonic
locking, unlocked sidebands, etc., over a wide range of injection strengths and frequencies. Our
work generalises the classic 1946 work of Adler to apply to arbitrary oscillators; indeed, Adler's
results constitute a special-case approximation of our result.</p>
<h4>Phase-locked loop systems</h4>
<p>We have validated the uses and benefits of PPV macromodels in system-level models of phase
locked loops (PLLs). Entrainment, capture, lock and cycle-slipping are dynamical phenomena of
considerable importance in PLLs. The problem of oscillator<i>PLL jitter caused by interference,
typically from power</i>ground<i>substrate connections, has also assumed great practical importance
in recent years. Prior phase macromodel based methods, all based on linear concepts, are often
inaccurate, in some cases egregiously, for predicting dynamical transients and interference-induced
jitter. We have shown that nonlinear PPV macromodels correctly and efficiently predict static phase
offsets, capture, lock and cycle-slipping transients, as well as jitter due to supply</i>ground interference
in oscillators and PLLs. We have developed design tools for extracting and using PPV macromodels
in a design flow, and used these tools (prototyped in SPICE<tt></tt>) to design a novel PLL which uses
injection locking to improve frequency acquisition time <a href="C57">C57</a>. This thread of our work has been
developed and reported in the publications <a href="C45">C45</a> (awarded Best Paper at ASPDAC 2005) <a href="C66">C66</a>
(invited paper), <a href="C61">C61</a>, <a href="C56">C56</a>, <a href="C51">C51</a> and <a href="C48">C48</a>.</p>
<h4>Electronic, biochemical and nanoscale systems of coupled oscillators</h4>
<p>We have applied PPV macromodels to simulate coupled systems of hundreds of thousands of oscil-
lators (arising in bio- and nano-systems) and successfully validated their ability to predict emergent
pattern formation and natural image processing in such networks <a href="C56">C56</a>, <a href="C66">C66</a> (invited paper).</p>
<h4>Mammalian and Drosophila circadian rhythm systems</h4>
<p>Circadian rhythms, or &ldquo;body clocks&rdquo;, control periodic daily changes in sleep<i>wakefulness, body
temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and other physiological variables. These rhythms stem
fundamentally from DNA-transcription biochemical oscillation mechanisms within individual cells and
their nuclei. Quantitative understanding, simulation and control of circadian rhythms is of great
practical importance: applications include devising medical remedies for rhythm disorders (e.g.,
insomnia, fatigue, jet lag, etc.), synthetic biology (where a goal is to &ldquo;program&rdquo; biologically viable
rhythms), artificially extending periods of wakefulness</i>alertness (e.g., for military purposes), and
understanding<i>treating a wide variety of medical problems strongly linked with circadian rhythms
(e.g., aspects of cancer, obesity, heart irregularities, psychological disorders, epilepsy, etc.).
We have applied and validated nonlinear PPV phase macromodels on mammalian and Drosophila
(fruit fly) circadian systems and successfully predicted the biologically crucial phenomenon of en-
trainment or synchronization to day</i>night cycles. We have applied our macromodels to simulate
systems of coupled circadian oscillators, predicting complex synchronization and locking amongst
the oscillators. Further, we have incorporated parameter dependencies into our circadian phase
macromodels and used them to predict endogenous period and phase changes in both endogenous
and entrained rhythms. This thread of research has been developed and reported in <a href="C73">C73</a>.</p>
<h2>Efficient computational methods for systems with widely separated time scales</h2>
<p>We have made contributions to theory and numerical methods for steady-state and envelope 
simulation of general systems of nonlinear differential equations. This thread of research is motivated by
the need for efficient simulation of systems with widely separated rates of temporal variation, i.e.,
waveforms in which feature both fast and slow characteristics. Applications abound in electronic,
biological, nanoscale, mechanical and optical systems. The many orders of magnitude that often
separate time scales of variation make standard numerical differential equation solvers inefficient
for such circuits.</p>
<h3>Multi-time Partial Differential Equations (MPDEs)</h3>
<p>Several of our contributions are rooted in the concept of multi-time partial differential equations
(MPDEs), which are a reformulation of ordinary differential equations as partial differential 
equations in artificial time scales. The use of separate time scales makes it possible to develop 
numerical techniques far more efficient than standard ones for systems with widely separated time scales.
Starting with a re-discovery of the basic MPDE formulation (crucial concepts of which can be traced
back to work of Petzold, Ngoya, and Brachtendorf), we systematically explored the MPDE for time
and frequency domain steady-state and envelope applications, showing that essentially all previous
steady-state and related techniques were in fact special cases obtained simply by choosing specific
solution choices for the MPDE (<a href="C14">C14</a>, <a href="BJ6">BJ6</a>). By using time-domain bases for discretizing the
MPDE, we derived numerical techniques for solving steady-state multi-tone and envelope problems
entirely in the time domain. This work was awarded Best Paper at DAC 1997 <a href="C14">C14</a>. Later, we
developed methods for multi-time analysis of systems with closely spaced tones <a href="C29">C29</a> <a href="BJ14">BJ14</a>.
15</p>
<h3>Warped time scales for MPDEs</h3>
<p>The numerical efficiency obtainable from the MPDE formulation relies on certain &ldquo;compact 
representation&rdquo; assumptions on the multivariate waveforms being solved for. We showed that these
assumptions do not hold for oscillators with strong frequency modulation (FM), an important class
of circuits. This difficulty led to the development of a more general MPDE than previously known,
which we dubbed the Warped MPDE or WaMPDE <a href="C21">C21</a>, <a href="C24">C24</a>, <a href="BJ10">BJ10</a>. The WaMPDE not only
restored efficiency for oscillator problems, but also presented unexpected and novel features such
as the ability to extract an explicit, time-varying, local frequency in forced oscillators. This work
was nominated for Best Paper at ASP-DAC 1999 <a href="C21">C21</a>.</p>
<h3>Robust Fourier envelope methods</h3>
<p>Using the MPDE formulation, we were also able to shed light on a number of apparently numer-
ical problems that had been observed in Fourier envelope methods. We showed that the issues
were deeper than simply numerical, stemming from that slow envelopes are not theoretically guar-
anteed in general for every multi-time initial condition. We developed approaches to find &ldquo;good&rdquo;
initial conditions that eliminate Fourier envelope problems in many situations <a href="C30">C30</a>, <a href="BJ15">BJ15</a>. We
also performed a systematic analysis of the stability properties of time-domain methods for the
MPDE <a href="C38">C38</a> <a href="BJ13">BJ13</a> (this work was nominated for the D.O. Pederson Best Paper award of
IEEE Trans. Computer-Aided Design).</p>
<h3>Multiple phase-condition and least-squares envelope methods</h3>
<p>Envelope-following methods face special challenges when applied to oscillators because of their
fundamental property of changing frequencies. This is especially true for circuits that switch dynam-
ically between autonomous and driven behaviour (such as PLLs). By unifying and extending ideas
from two prior oscillator envelope-following approaches (Petzold's method and the WaMPDE),
we have developed general techniques for effective oscillator envelope following. Our technique
uses two extra system unknowns, together with extra &ldquo;phase condition&rdquo; equations <a href="BJ22">BJ22</a>, <a href="C54">C54</a>
or minimum least-squares solution <a href="C60">C60</a> to track quantities related to dynamical frequency/time-
period changes. These advances confer significant robustness without appreciable computational
overhead.</p>
<h3>GeMPDE and oscillator AC</h3>
<p>Standard small-signal analysis methods break down for oscillators because small-input perturba-
tions result in large output changes, thus invalidating fundamental assumptions for small-signal
analysis. We have developed a hierarchy of generalizations of the MPDE/WaMPDE, collectively
termed the GeMPDE. Using the GeMPDE framework which restores validity and rigour to 
smallsignal analysis of oscillators. A key feature of our approach is to solve for bivariate frequency
variables, with the help of augmenting-phase-condition equations <a href="C53">C53</a>, <a href="BJ19">BJ19</a> and least-squares
solution methods <a href="C58">C58</a>. Unlike prior oscillator analysis methods, which require special handling
of the phase mode, our oscillator AC method provides both amplitude and frequency characteristics
in a unified manner and is applicable to any kind of oscillator described by differential-algebraic
equations.</p>
<h3>Harmonic balance for systems with unbounded phase</h3>
<p>A unique feature of oscillators is that small external perturbations can lead to unboundedly large
changes in phase, thereby making standard harmonic balance (HB) inapplicable for simulation of
systems containing nonlinear phase macromodels of oscillators. We have developed and validated
a novel extension of HB that is capable of handling oscillator phase macromodels <a href="C63">C63</a>. Key to the
new method, termed PPV-HB, is a formulation that separates unboundedly increasing phase terms
from the bounded, periodic components.</p>
<h3>Fast latch setup/hold characterization and abstraction</h3>
<p>Characterizing setup and hold times of latches and registers is crucial for timing closure of large
digital designs ­ typically taking months of computation in industry. By formulating the setup<i>hold
time problem as a scalar nonlinear equation h( ) = 0, derived using state-transition functions,
and then solving this equation by Newton-Raphson (NR), we have developed a novel approach
<a href="C67">C67</a> for fast abstraction of setup</i>hold times from detailed low-level circuit descriptions of latches
and registers. Furthermore, we have extended this method via Euler-Newton curve tracing and
Moore-Penrose nonlinear Newton solution to characterize latch setup<i>hold times in an 
interdependent manner <a href="C69">C69</a>, <a href="BJ26">BJ26</a>. This is a key enabler for pessimism reduction in timing via Setup</i>Hold
Interdependence Aware Static Timing Analysis. This work was awarded Best Paper at DAC 2007
<a href="C69">C69</a>.</p>
<h2>Efficient prediction of noise and variability effects in systems</h2>
<p>We have made contributions to theory and numerical techniques for computing noise and parameter
variability effects in large mixed-signal and RF systems. Our contributions include fast 
computational techniques for cyclostationary (&ldquo;mixing&rdquo;) noise, phase noise, and parameter sensitivities, and
fast yield estimation for systems with parameter variations.</p>
<h3>Cyclostationary noise: theory and efficient computational algorithms</h3>
<p>We have made advances to the theory of, and developed efficient frequency-domain numerical
techniques for, computing cyclostationary noise in large circuits. Our contribution addressed the 
problem of correct and efficient computational noise analysis of circuits such as integrated on-chip RF
mixers and switched-capacitor filters. Integrated RF circuits typically contain hundreds or 
thousands of nonlinear devices, which pose a special challenge to traditional simulation and steady-state
computation algorithms. Prior frequency-domain techniques for cyclostationary noise suffered from
cubic computational complexity and were thus suited only for circuits of small size.
We showed that the large harmonic power-spectral density (HPSD) matrices that arise in this 
computational problem always have a block structure which can be decomposed into a sum/product form
of Toeplitz and diagonal matrices. Using circulant approximations to the Toeplitz matrices, and 
applying preconditioned iterative techniques for linear system solution, we reduced the computational
complexity of the problem to approximately linear in circuit size, thus making cyclostationary noise
analysis practical for on-chip RF circuit blocks with thousands of devices <a href="C11">C11</a>, <a href="C12">C12</a>, <a href="BJ2">BJ2</a>. This
work was awarded Best Paper at ASP-DAC 1997 <a href="C11">C11</a>. In the process of formulating efficient
noise computation algorithms, we also developed a cleaner, simpler mathematical formulation of
cyclostationary noise in circuits than previously available. Using this, we derived simple linear 
filtering conditions for restoring stationarity to cyclostationary noise <a href="BJ2">BJ2</a>, thereby extending classic
work of Str¨om and Signell.</p>
<h3>Theory and algorithms for nonlinear phase noise analysis of oscillators</h3>
<p>We have addressed the long-standing theoretical and computational problem of correctly predicting
the effect of perturbations and noise on the phase of free-running oscillators. The oscillator phase
noise problem is important in several scientific and engineering disciplines and a precise 
understanding of its mechanisms has been sought for decades. In electronics and chip design, phase noise/jitter
is a leading cause of system performance degradation; incorrect prediction of phase noise has been
a key factor in chip failure, resulting in expensive and time-consuming re-spins. In the optical do-
main, the problem of predicting a laser's line width is essentially that of computing the phase-noise
spectrum of an optical oscillator.</p>
<p>While many attempts had been made to solve the phase noise problem, and correct solutions found
for certain specific oscillators (e.g., the work of Lax for certain lasers, and that of Abidi for ring
oscillators), a correct general theory applicable to all oscillators was not available prior to our work.
Alternative theories, including popular recent ones, have been shown to suffer from fundamental
inconsistencies and to be inadequate for general applicability, often leading to egregious artifacts
such as predicting infinite noise power.</p>
<p>Our work on oscillator phase noise <a href="C67">C67</a>, <a href="C17">C17</a>, <a href="C16">C16</a>, <a href="BJ5">BJ5</a> is based on a stochastic analysis of
the nonlinear PPV phase macromodel described in Section A.1.3. We solved the nonlinear 
differential equation comprising the PPV macromodel analytically for white stochastic inputs to obtain a
statistical characterization of phase error, from which phase noise power spectral densities and jitter
figures of merit were obtained. We showed that phase errors under Gaussian white noise 
perturbations are a Gaussian random walk that becomes stationary in the asymptotic limit. We developed
computational methods for predicting phase noise and jitter much more accurately than previously
possible. We later developed accurate and efficient techniques <a href="C25">C25</a>, <a href="BJ9">BJ9</a> for computing the 
Perturbation Projection Vector (PPV), a key Floquet quantity on which the above theory is based. We
showed that it is possible to accurately and efficiently extract the PPV, with negligible computation,
using a single linear solution at the oscillator's time-varying linearized steady state.</p>
<h3>Variability in mixed-signal and biological systems</h3>
<p>Parameter variability is of great importance and concern in VLSI design today; it is also of 
crucial importance in biological systems. Our work in this area encompasses the exploration of novel
bio-mimetic design techniques to counteract undesirable effects of variability, as well as CAD 
techniques for propagating or abstracting the effects of low-level variability to higher-level effects.
We have extended theory and numerical techniques for generating oscillator PPV phase 
macromodels that incorporate variability in circuit parameters without the need for re-extraction. In other
words, we have developed computational techniques for extracting parameterized oscillator phase
macromodels, and validated these on systems of LC and ring oscillators <a href="C68">C68</a>. Further, we have
established a simple formula for the parameter sensitivity of oscillator center frequency in terms of
variability-enabled PPV components <a href="C70">C70</a>.</p>
<p>Large parameter variations are the norm in most biological systems and there is considerable interest
in characterizing and understanding such systems&rsquo; robustness to variability. Parameter sensitivities
are also heavily utilized for biological model development and refinement. We have applied our
variability-equipped PPV macromodels to mammalian and Drosophila circadian rhythm systems
<a href="C73">C73</a>, and demonstrated the robustness of such systems to variations in a variety of physical 
parameters.</p>
<h3>Parametric yield calculation for SRAM cells and oscillators</h3>
<p>Accurate estimation of the effects of threshold variations, in particular yield loss, is crucial during
the design of robust SRAM cells and memory arrays in deep submicron technologies. We have
developed novel efficient techniques to calculate yield loss due to access-time, static noise margin,
etc.., related failures <a href="C71">C71</a>, <a href="C72">C72</a>. Our methods do not rely on Monte-Carlo techniques; instead,
they find the boundary in parameter space between success and failure regions, and use quick 
geometrical calculations to find the yield. The boundary curve is found efficiently via an Euler-Newton
curve tracing technique, adapted from mixed-signal/RF simulation, that guides detailed SPICE-level
simulation with accurate MOS device models. Our algorithms scale gracefully in the case of many
parameters. This work <a href="C72">C72</a> has been awarded Best Paper at ASP-DAC 2008.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous contributions</h2>
<h3>Describing function analysis of injection locking in LC oscillators</h3>
<p>We have extended the classic describing function method, originally for analysing amplitude and
frequency properties of undisturbed nonlinear LC oscillators, to develop a simple and intuitive, yet
rigorous and general, method for understanding injection locking and predicting it quantitatively
<a href="C62">C62</a>, <a href="C50">C50</a>.</p>
<h3>Robust homotopy/continuation for large mixed-signal circuits</h3>
<p>We have successfully solved the long-standing circuit simulation problem of finding a numerical
DC operating point of large practical circuits in a robust, &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; manner. Our approach 
involves the application and adaptation of globally-convergent numerical continuation methods. Prior
approaches using these techniques had been largely unsuccessful for circuits containing more than
a few tens of transistors. By developing novel two and three phase homotopy models with 
decoupled continuation parameters for metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) and other transistor devices,
together with robustness improvements to continuation algorithms for intricate high-dimensional
tracks, we obtained a numerical DC algorithm that scaled well to large circuits and was well suited
for broad practical application <a href="C8">C8</a>, apparently for the first time. This work was recognized by a
citation for &lsquo;Extraordinary Achievement and Impact&rsquo; from Bell Laboratories. We also 
identified connections between certain circuit topologies and exponential path-lengths of homotopy tracks
<a href="BJ16">BJ16</a>. This development is a key step towards further, more generic, homotopies that confer the
robustness we have achieved for MOS circuits to much wider classes of devices, as well as for
steady-state equation systems, which are more complex than DC ones.</p>
<h3>Time-domain simulation of lossy transmission lines (PhD topic)</h3>
<p>During my PhD, I developed analytical time-domain methods for simulating lossy transmission
lines. The problem was motivated by the long, thin interconnections that carry digital signals in
multi-chip modules and large chips. The presence of resistive losses in transmission lines leads to
waveform dispersion, in addition to delays and reflection effects, that can significantly affect the
integrity of digital signals travelling through the lines.</p>
<p>To simulate such effects without resorting to spatial discretization, I first developed exact analytical
formulae for a lossy transmission line's impulse responses (kernels). I then developed analytical
formulae for numerical convolution with these kernels <a href="C1">C1</a>. By tracking the internal state of the
transmission line numerically, I was able to develop a modified convolution method that eliminated
the quadratic-time computational complexity of generic numerical convolution <a href="C2">C2</a>, <a href="BJ1">BJ1</a>. Other
aspects of this thread of research included extensions to lossy multi-conductor lines <a href="C1">C1</a>, purely
RC lines <a href="C4">C4</a>, and to skin effect <a href="C3">C3</a>, <a href="BJ1">BJ1</a>. <a href="C2">C2</a> was awarded Distinguished Paper at ICCAD
1991, while <a href="C1">C1</a> and <a href="C3">C3</a> were nominated for Best Paper at DAC 1991 and 1992.
After graduation, I developed extensions to shaped RLC transmission lines <a href="C5">C5</a>. I also made minor contributions
to a more general quadrature-based numerical technique for avoiding quadratic
complexity, developed primarily by two collaborators <a href="C9">C9</a>.</p>
